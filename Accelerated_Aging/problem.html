  <h1>Accelerated Aging</h1>
  <p>Happy new year!</p>
  <p>
    It is a Korean tradition to eat a bowl of Tteokguk (rice cake soup) on New
    Year's Day, and only then their age goes up by 1. Everyone ages up on New
    Year's Day, regardless of their birthdays.

      (see wikipedia on Korean Age Reckoning)
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Alice and Bob are 15 years old twins born on the same day. Since Korea has a
    culture of using honorifics to older kids, Alice and Bob want to get as old
    as possible by eating lots and lots of tteokguk. For every bowl of tteokguk
    they eat, they will age up 1 year.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are $N$ bowls of tteokguk prepared. To ensure fair division of
    tteokguk, Alice and Bob take turns claiming tteokguk bowls. Alice goes
    first, Bob goes next.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each turn, Alice and Bob can do one of the following:
    <li>Take one bowl</li>
    <li>
      If the number of remaining bowls is even, take half of the remaining bowls
    </li>
    <li>If the number of remaining bowls is a multiple of 3, take 2 bowls</li>
    <li>If the number of remaining bowls is a multiple of 5, take 3 bowls</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    Both Alice and Bob try to get as old as possible. They will both make
    optimal choices to maximize their own age, keeping in mind that their twin
    will do the same. How old will Alice and Bob be after they finish all the
    tteokguk if they make optimal choices?
    <b>
      They are both 15 years old before they start eating, so don't forget to
      add 15 to the answer!
    </b>
  </p>

  <h2>Input</h2>
  <p>
    A single integer $N$ - the number of tteokguk bowls Alice and Bob have to
    share.
  </p>
  <p>$1 \leq N \leq 10000$ <br /></p>
  <h2>Output</h2>
  <p>
    Output two integers on a single line - the ages of Alice and Bob after they
    finish all the tteokguk, assuming both are making optimal choices.
  </p>
  <h3>Sample Input 1</h3>
  <pre>
1       
  </pre>
  <h3>Sample Output 1</h3>
  <pre>
16 15
  </pre>
  <p>
    Since Alice goes first, she takes the only bowl of tteokguk. There are no
    bowls left for Bob to take.
  </p>
  <h3>Sample Input 2</h3>
  <pre>
4 
  </pre>
  <h3>Sample Output 2</h3>
  <pre>
18 16
  </pre>
  <p>
    Here is a sequence of optimal actions:
    <li>4 bowls left: Alice takes half of the remaining bowls.</li>
    <li>2 bowls left: Bob takes one bowl.</li>
    <li>1 bowl left: Alice takes one bowl.</li>
    Overall, Alice ate 3 bowls and Bob ate 1. Therefore, Alice is now 18 years
    old and Bob is 16 years old.
