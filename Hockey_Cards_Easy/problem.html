    <h1>Hockey Cards (Easy)</h1>
    <p>
        Marly, an avid collector of hockey cards, decided to spend her day organizing
        her extensive collection of $n$ cards.
        Each card represents a different player and has three attributes,
        <b>Name</b>, <b>Top Speed</b>, and <b>Height</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Marly has very particular preferences for her cards, such as favoring
        players whose names start with a certain letter over those with specific
        height ranges.
        The preferences are provided in the form of selection criteria,
        where a selection can be one of:
        <ul>
            <li><code>Name a b</code>:
                All players whose names start with a letter between $a$ and $b$.</li>
            <li><code>Speed x y</code>:
                All players with a top speed between $x$ and $y$.</li>
            <li><code>Height x y</code>:
                All players with a height between $x$ and $y$.</li>
        </ul>
        All ranges are inclusive. $a$ and $b$ here would be capital letters,
        while $x$ and $y$ are integers.
        It is guaranteed that $a \leq b$ (alphabetically), and $x \leq y$.
        For instance, <code>Name A C</code> would include players
        whose names start with <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, or <code>C</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your goal is to assist Marly in ordering her cards in a pile from most
        to least preferred, adhering to her given constraints.
        If no valid ordering exists, tell her so.
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line of input holds two integers $n$ and $q$.
        $n$ is the number of hockey cards that Marly has.
        $q$ is the number of preferences.
        The next $n$ lines each denote a hockey card, and contain a string starting
        with a capital letter (name), and two integers, speed and height respectively.
        All names are unique.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following are $q$ lines, each denoting a preference.
        Preferences are expressed as pairs of selections, as explained above,
        and are seperated by a greater-than symbol $&gt;$,
        denoting that <b>all cards</b> in the first selection are preferred over
        <b>all cards</b> in the second selection.
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Output a list of names denoting the pile of cards in any order
        satisfying Marly's preferences,
        with her most preferred card on top.
        If no valid ordering exists, output <br>
        <code>your preferences are wrong</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Bounds</h2>
    <p>
        $n \leq 1000$.<br>
        $q \leq 1000$.<br>
        All Speed attributes are between $15$ and $70$.<br>
        All Height attributes are between $50$ and $220$.<br>
    </p>
