  <h1>Hidden Password</h1>
  <p>
    In Cyberplex, a hacker named Cipher has hidden a vital password within an
    $N$x$N$ grid of characters. The password is hidden somewhere in the grid,
    either horizontally, vertically, diagonally, or even reversed! The city's
    systems are paralyzed, and you, a skilled coder, are tasked to find the
    hidden word. Can you parse the grid of characters and determine which of the
    $M$ possibilities is the password, or will the city remain locked in a
    digital enigma forever?
  </p>
  <p>Only one of the $M$ possible passwords will be hidden in the grid.</p>
  <h2>Input</h2>
  <p>
    The first line contains an integer $N$ - the size of the grid. Next, there
    will be an $N$ by $N$ grid of characters containing the hidden password.
    Finally, there will be an integer $M$, followed by $M$ lines containing the
    possibilities for the hidden password.
  </p>
  <p>The only characters used in this problem are from a-z.</p>
  <p>
    $3 \leq N \leq 10$ <br />
    $3 \leq M \leq 10$ <br />
  </p>
  <h2>Output</h2>
  <p>
    The hidden password that appears in the grid either horizontally,
    vertically, diagonally, or reversed (8 possible directions).
