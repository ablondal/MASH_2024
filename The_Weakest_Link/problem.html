  <h1>The Weakest Link</h1>
  <p>
    Bob has been put in charge of organizing the $N$ players with various skill
    levels into teams of two for the “Pair Programming” tournament. The overall
    skill level of a team is the sum of the skill levels of its two members.
    Since these teams will be competing head-to-head in front of a large crowd,
    Bob wants to form the teams so that the matches are as entertaining for the
    spectators. More specifically, Bob's idea is to form teams in such a way
    that the weakest team has an overall skill level that is as high as
    possible. This will ensure that the matches between the teams are close and
    entertaining. Assuming Bob forms teams in such a way that maximizes the
    skill level of the weakest team, what would be the skill level of the
    weakest team?

  <h2>Input</h2>
  <p>
    The first line contains a single integer $N$ - the number of players. $N$ is
    guaranteed to be even. The next line will contain $N$ integers $s_1$, $s_2$,
    …, $s_n$, where $s_i$ is the skill level of the $i_th$ player.
  </p>
  <p>
    $4 \leq N \leq 1000$ <br />
    $1 \leq s_i \leq 1000$ <br />
  </p>
  <h2>Output</h2>
  <p>
    Output a single integer - the maximum possible skill level of the weakest
    team.

  <h3>Sample Explanation</h3>
  <p>
    There are 3 possible team formations: <br />
    <li>5 & 4, 1 & 3 -> weakest team skill = 4</li>
    <li>5 & 1, 4 & 3 -> weakest team skill = 6</li>
    <li>5 & 3, 4 & 1 -> weakest team skill = 5</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    The second formation maximizes the skill of the weakest team, with an
    overall skill level of 6.
