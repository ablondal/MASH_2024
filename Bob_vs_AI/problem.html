  <h1>Bob vs AI</h1>
  <p>
    Bob just graduated from university and is looking to land his first software
    engineering job. After a couple weeks of searching, Bob gets an interview
    request from his dream company! He carefully reads the portion of the email
    that explains the interview process:
  </p>
  <pre>
    You will be given N leetcode-style questions to solve.
    These same questions will be given to M cutting-edge AI models to solve as well.
    To pass the interview, you must solve more questions correctly than each of the AI models.
  </pre>
  <p>
    Given the probabilities that Bob and the AI models will solve each question
    correctly, help Bob calculate the probability that he will pass the
    interview.
  </p>

  <h2>Input</h2>
  <p>
    The first line will contain two integers $N$ and $M$ - the number of
    questions to solve, and the number of AI models that Bob has to compete
    against.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second line will contain N decimal values between $0$ and $1$. The $i$th
    number is the probability that Bob will solve the $i$th problem correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next there will be $M$ lines, each containing $N$ decimal values between $0$
    and $1$. The $i$th number in the $j$th line is the probability that the
    $i$th problem will be solved correctly by the $j$th AI model.
  </p>
  <p>
    $1 \leq N \leq 1000$ <br />
    $1 \leq M \leq 10$ <br />
  </p>
  <h2>Output</h2>
  <p>
    A single decimal value between $0$ and $1$ - the probability that Bob solves
    more questions correctly than each of the AI models.
    <strong>
      Your output must have an absolute or relative error of less than 10^-6 to
      be considered correct.
