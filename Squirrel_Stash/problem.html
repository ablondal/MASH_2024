    <h1>Squirrel Stash</h1>
    <p>
        In the fall, squirrels' brains have been shown to increase in size
        up to 15%.
        This is in order to help them remember all the places they've
        hidden their food away for the winter.
        Stella is one such squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the frosty depths of winter, Stella's silhouette has slimmed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Springtime had her secretly stashing seeds, smuggling them into
        spy-proof stores.
        Since then, snow has shielded the sticks she sorted as signposts 
        for her subsistence stores. 
        As a savvy squirrel, however, she studied a system to spare 
        her the starvation that might stem from this situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        She summons strings of memory, strides that send her in sequence
        to each stash where a scrumptious supply securely sleeps. 
        Support Stella's search, so she swiftly snags sustenance from 
        the snow-laden soil!
    </p>
    <p>
        Her territory is modelled as a two-dimensional plane, 
        and Stella starts at the point (0, 0), pointing East (towards (1, 0)). 
        She remembers a list of actions that she took to hide her food. 
        Each action is either a distance walked straight, 
        a counter-clockwise turn, or a seed stashed. 
        Output the position of each seed she buried, in order.
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line will contain an integer $n$, 
        indicating the number of actions Stella remembers.
        $n$ lines follow.
        Each one consists of one of three possible actions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>stride d</code>: Indicates that Stella walked $d$ metres directly forward.</li>
        <li><code>spin r</code>:
            Indicates that Stella turned exactly r degrees counter-clockwise.
        </li>
        <li><code>stash</code>:
            Indicates that Stella stashed a seed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        $d$ and $r$ are guaranteed to be integers.<br>
        $1 \leq n \leq 100$<br>
        $1 \leq d \leq 100$<br>
        $0 \leq r \leq 359$
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Print $n$ lines, one for each of Stella's stash commands.
        Line $i$ should contain the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of Stella's $i$th stash.
        Your answer will be considered correct if each number in your answer
        has absolute or relative error smaller than 10^-3.
