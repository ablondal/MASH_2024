    <h1>Dizzy Bob</h1>
    <p>
        Bob is stuck in an $N$ by $M$ rectangular maze and needs to find a way out.
        Unfortunately, Bob’s task is made harder by the fact that he gets dizzy extremely easily.
        In fact, even just a 90 degree turn may cause him to lose his balance and fall down. 
        To reduce the risk of falling down, Bob wants to find a path through the rectangular maze that requires him to change direction the least number of times possible.
        Bob starts in the top-left corner of the maze, and the exit is at the bottom-right corner of the maze. 
        Bob can only move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right), and can’t pass through any obstacles in his way. 
        What is the minimum number of times he must change direction before reaching the exit?
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line contains two integers $N$ and $M$ - the height and width of the maze respectively.
        Next, there will be an $N$ by $M$ grid of characters that shows the structure of the maze.
        A $#$ represents an obstacle, while a $.$ represents an area that Bob can walk on.
        It is guaranteed that there are no obstacles in the top left and bottom right corners of the maze. 
    </p>
    <p>
        $1 \leq N \leq 1000$ <br>
        $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Output a single integer - the minimum number of times that Bob must change direction to reach the exit.
        If there is no path that Bob can take to reach the exit, output -1.
