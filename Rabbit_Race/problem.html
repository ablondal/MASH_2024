    <h1>Rabbit Race</h1>
    <p>
        Ralph participates in an annual rabbit race.
        Rabbits are special, because they never get tired and only ever run around
        a track at top speed<sup>(citation needed)</sup>.
        This is a special rabbit race, where rabbits compete in a team.
        Rabbits run laps around a track of length $l$ cm, but the team only finishes
        when all the rabbits cross the finish line simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, because the organizers encourage team cohesiveness over raw speed,
        each team's finish time is multiplied by the speed of its fastest rabbit
        (in cm/s) to get their <b>final time</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Normally, Ralph trains his rabbits, but this year he forgot,
        and they're so lazy that they won't even run.
        In a rush to assemble a team, he visits a pet shop,
        expecting to find a few rabbits that he'll have to settle for.
        However, he is surprised to find a couple hundred ($1 \leq n \leq 200$)
        rabbits to choose from!
        Furthermore, expecting business from rabbit racers, the shop owner has
        labeled each rabbit with its speed in cm/s ($1 \leq v_i \leq 10000$).
    </p>
    <p>
        Help Ralph find the optimal set of $k$ rabbits ($1 \leq k \leq 6$) 
        that can finish the race the fastest!
    </p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>
        The first line of input contains three integers: $n$, $k$, and $l$,
        the number of rabbits in the shop, the size of a team,
        and the length of the track.
        The next line contains $n$ integers $v_1, \dots, v_n$, the speeds
        of all the rabbits.
    </p>
    <p>
        $1 \leq n \leq 200$<br>
        $1 \leq k \leq \min(6, n)$<br>
        $1 \leq l \leq 10000$<br>
        $1 \leq v_i \leq 10000$
    </p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
        Output a single integer - the minimum <b>final time</b> in seconds that any
        set of $k$ rabbits from the shop can achieve
        (don't forget the penalty for the fastest rabbit).
    </p>
<h3>Sample Input 1</h3>
<pre>
2 1 100
1 2
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output 1</h3>
<pre>
100
</pre>
<p>Since only one rabbit is needed, we can choose any!</p>
<h3>Sample Input 2</h3>
<pre>
5 2 100
9 8 10 7 15
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output 2</h3>
<pre>
300
</pre>
<p>
    Even though they accumulate the highest penalty,
    the rabbits with speeds 10 and 15 are so fast that they finish the
    race in 20 seconds.
    Their penalty only brings them up to a final time of 300 seconds.

5 2 64
